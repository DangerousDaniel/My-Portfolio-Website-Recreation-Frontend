The objective is to save the monsters in the cages throughout the level from enemies. They will follow you back to home and help you on your conquest. Once at their home, the mother of the monsters you were saving will attack you, enraged because it got possessed by a dark spirit. She becomes much bigger than she usually is and has purple spikes. Once you defeat it, some of the monsters you saved will join your party while others stay behind with their mother."
